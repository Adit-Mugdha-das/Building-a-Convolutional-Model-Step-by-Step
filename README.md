# Convolutional Model Step-by-Step

This assignment builds a convolutional neural network (CNN) step-by-step by implementing the forward and backward passes for convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers.  
It is part of **Week 1 (Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks)** from the **Deep Learning Specialization** by **Andrew Ng** on Coursera.

##  Description

In this lab, I manually coded the basic building blocks of a CNN from scratch using NumPy, including:
- Convolution operations
- Activation functions
- Pooling layers (max pooling)
- Flattening and fully connected (dense) layers
- Forward and backward propagation for each component

This provides a deep understanding of how modern convolutional architectures work internally before using high-level frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Convolution operations and stride/padding
- Max pooling and dimensionality reduction
- Implementing forward and backward propagation through CNN layers
- Gradient flow through convolutional and pooling layers
- End-to-end pipeline of a CNN

##  Files Included

- `cnn_model_step_by_step.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for step-by-step CNN implementation
- `cnn_utils.py`: Helper functions for data preprocessing and visualization
- `datasets/`: Includes sample images used for model testing

> ⚠️ This repository contains only my own code and follows Coursera’s Honor Code.

##  Tools Used

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
